Tell us what’s been bothering you and our Engineering team will be more than happy to check it out. </p><p>All fixes listed below have been committed and merged, but may still be rolling out to individual platforms at the time of this post. </p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>Highlights<br/></strong></h2><ul role="list"><li>Foldable users, we heard you and we have good news: we’ve invested heavily in foldable device support recently! You should notice dramatic improvements in how Discord functions on your foldable device. We’ve also invested in future-proofing our code base so foldables should “just work” moving forward, rather than requiring bespoke support. Please report issues you find on these devices via the <a href="https://dis.gd/reddit-bug-megathread">/r/discordapp subreddit Megathread</a> or a<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"> Support ticket</a>. </li><li>Discord now has better multitasking/Sidecar/side-by-side app view support. Changing the dimensions of the mobile application should intelligently swap between different ways of viewing our app, giving you far more flexibility in these scenarios. We hope you love the quality of life improvements here for multitasking.</li><li>You’re now able to set a keybind to toggle screen sharing on macOS 15+. Previously, this was only a Windows feature. You can set a keybind for “Toggle Screen Share” in User Settings &gt; Keybinds.</li><li>We’re looking <em>everywhere</em> for performance improvements at Discord, so we recently took some time to improve the performance of<a href="https://discord.com/"> Discord.com</a>! We shipped a suite of changes that reduced page load time for users by up to 4 seconds on average, as well as improving other core vitals. The website should feel significantly more responsive now.</li></ul></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/october-staff-picks-monster-season" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fe753507166412b717697_image4.png 1800w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/company" class="blog-hero-category">Discord HQ</a><a href="/blog/october-staff-picks-monster-season" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">October Staff Picks: Monster Season</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>Forget ghosts, ghouls, and goliaths… we know the REAL monster is the games backlog that hides in the shadows!

Who are ya?! </strong>‍</h2><p>Heyooo! I’m Tyler, and I’m on Discord’s Recruiting Operations team. <strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Spooky season is upon us! What games did you end up playing last month?</strong></h2><p>As many of you can probably relate to, I have a huge game backlog. I do my best to power through it, but… I’m a sucker for JRPGs and Atlus games specifically, so I couldn&#x27;t resist picking up <strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong>! <br/><br/>It feels like a high fantasy version of Persona, which I dig. My favorite feature, Social Links, has returned as “Bonds:” You build relationships with NPCs by spending time with them, which in turn unlocks new classes and upgrades them. I’m about 15 hours in (to what is probably an 80+ hour game), but already am loving all of the characters and what I’ve seen of the story. </p><p>When I can tear myself away, I’m practicing my speedrun of <strong>Gravity Circuit</strong> for an upcoming event. It’s an indie platformer, Mega Man-like game that I highly recommend! It has really tight controls and the platforming feels great — you have a ton of movement tools like wall jumping, a hookshot, divekicks, and even super moves. You’ll feel like a speedrunner even just playing through the game normally! The music is also incredible — I caught myself humming a few of the stage songs while working or doing chores around the house. </p><figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/671fce2a7fa002e7b00c2e6e_ss_7f29c50dff35a2aab45ab4f0fb40598964284bf6.1920x1080.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot from the game “Gravity Circuit.”"/></div><figcaption>Gravity Circuit (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/858710/Gravity_Circuit/">Steam</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>For my speedrun, I’m doing the “Dog%” category - throughout the stages, there are a variety of friendly robots that need to be rescued. In the whole game, two of them are lil pups (Yuki and Amadeus). In Dog%, you need to rescue both dogs in their two stages, head back to base, and last but not least, pet them both. </p><p>So I guess the spookiest thing about all this is that the ghosts of my backlog will continue to haunt me another day. xD</p><h2><strong>It wouldn&#x27;t be October if we didn’t talk about some monsters. What is one of your favorite video game monsters?  </strong></h2><p>I’m a big fan of Final Fantasy, and one of my favorite monsters is the Tonberry. “He’s just a little guy!” you might exclaim upon first seeing one, and then the Tonberry will one-hit KO you. From then on, Tonberries are quite a bit spookier. Super adorable, but super deadly — which, in my opinion, should be the fundamentals of all monster design! </p></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/how-to-play-games-listen-to-music-improve-your-discord-server-with-apps" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2).png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-2000.png 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-2600.png 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2)-p-3200.png 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/672165db4c87e38208370925_Products%20%26%20Features%20-%201%20(2).png 3600w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/how-to-discord" class="blog-hero-category">How to Discord</a><a href="/blog/how-to-play-games-listen-to-music-improve-your-discord-server-with-apps" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">How to Play Games, Listen to Music, and Improve Your Discord Server with Apps &amp; Activities</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p><strong>Apps </strong>on Discord help bring a bit more liveliness to your conversations with useful features, text-based games, and tools for any situation.

You’re in luck: the newly refreshed Player’s Handbook makes it a snap for beginner and experienced players alike to set forth on exciting new journeys with ease.</p><p>Discord has become a core component for many D&amp;D adventurers across the world. Some play the game completely digitally with apps like Roll20, while others use their cameras in a Discord voice chat to show off huuuge, custom-made terrain, and meticulously crafted figures that represent their fantasy selves. </p><p>We also <em>LOVE</em> D&amp;D at Discord, so in honor of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ 50th anniversary, we’re celebrating in two stylish ways: bringing you some brand new tabletop adventures — directly in Discord — to you and your party, and offering more ways to look the part when you’re playing your next campaign in chat. </p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>New &amp; Seasoned Adventurers: Try Discord’s One Shot!<br/></strong></h2><p>This Halloween season, we’re bringing a Discord twist to your adventures into worlds unknown.

Our goal was to create an advertising format where everyone wins: Players discover new games and earn rewards for playing their favorite games, and developers authentically engage their audience. </p><p>It’s still early, but the positive feedback from the millions of players who have completed a Quest has exceeded our expectations. We’ve run dozens of Quests campaigns for some of the biggest titles, including Fortnite, Genshin Impact, and World of Warcraft. These campaigns have delivered strong results, driving a 16% lift in average playtime and 9% lift in average player counts. To see results like this — consistently — so early in our journey, is encouraging.</p><p>Venture on for a deeper dive into some of the early Quests results, which fuel our ambition to deliver the world’s most player-centric ads. Plus, you’ll learn details on a new type of Quest coming to Discord later this year.</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>Quests are Driving Gameplay</strong></h2><p>Quests are designed to help connect developers to players, and early campaign results show that’s exactly what’s happening. </p><p><a href="https://discord.com/quests-success-stories/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact’s</a> first Quest drove an 80% increase in gameplay hours and a 3x increase in friend to friend streams. Our <a href="https://discord.com/quests-success-stories/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a> Quest had more than one million participants, and as part of WoW’s PR and marketing efforts it contributed to a 63% increase in the number of people playing the game on Discord. Simply put: when players streamed the game to their friends, more of their friends joined in. </p><p>Indie developers are experiencing success too. 90% of the players who joined the <a href="https://discord.com/quests-success-stories/krunker-strike-frvr">Krunker Strike</a> Quest through the Activity on Discord were either new or lapsed — leading to a 33% increase in player count during launch week.</p><p>We’re really encouraged by early results and the measurable impact Quests have in helping developers grow their business — but there’s more to do. In particular, developers have been asking for more ways to bring their games to our users, especially upcoming games and major content releases, like new seasons and DLC drops.</p></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/discord-patch-notes-october-1-2024" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6657ad0a58988c5decbfbc53_Header_3.png 1800w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/product" class="blog-hero-category">Product &amp; Features</a><a href="/blog/discord-patch-notes-october-1-2024" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">Discord Patch Notes: October 1, 2024</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>Welcome to Patch Notes! In this series, we comb through the newest changes in performance, reliability, responsiveness, usability, and general bug-squishing we’ve done to make Discord better. </p><p>If you discover a bug of your own, check out our <a href="https://dis.gd/reddit-bug-megathread">Bimonthly Bug Megathread</a> on the community-ran r/DiscordApp subreddit. Tell us what’s been bothering you and our Engineering team will be more than happy to check it out. </p><p>All fixes listed below have been committed and merged, but may still be rolling out to individual platforms at the time of this post.</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>Highlights<br/></strong></h2><ul role="list"><li>We’ve made significant improvements to the Android chat renderer recently. These changes reduced slow frames by as much as 60% depending on your device, and we’re measuring ~12% reduced memory used by the chat list. Actions such as scrolling through chat histories in Android should feel and look much smoother now. </li><li>We recently shipped a change that virtualizes the server list on mobile platforms. This change primarily helps users in large numbers of servers by only allowing visible servers in the list to remain loaded in the app at any given time. For users in a large number of servers, we’ve measured improvements of 14% in memory usage and 25% in CPU usage. If you’re one of these users, you may notice a difference in general performance of the app following this change. </li><li>Thanks to a recent fix of a long-standing issue, unread indicators should now consistently render above the correct message on mobile — even if you’re popular and have <em>many</em> unread messages.</li><li>We’ve made changes to our data stores on iOS to reduce the amount of space used on devices. Following this work, disk usage for the 1% most affected iOS users went from 5.7 GB to 1.7 GB. </li><li>We’ve updated the UX for initiating a screen share on MacOS to be more consistent with other experiences. It’s also a bit sleeker visually now.</li><li>We shipped a new Soundboard UI on desktop, making it easier to navigate around and interact with individual sounds. We also dig the aesthetic more, and hope you like it, too!</li><li>Discord now supports playing Animated WebP attachments on our web and desktop platforms. WebP files offer a lot of benefits, including smoother playback and reduced bandwidth usage over other formats.</li></ul></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/september-staff-picks-mid-travel-pitstop" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f494784e6b69e236aaf064_StaffPicks%20BlogHeader%20September.png 1800w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/company" class="blog-hero-category">Discord HQ</a><a href="/blog/september-staff-picks-mid-travel-pitstop" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">September Staff Picks: Mid-Travel Pitstop</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>By the time you read this, the summer travel season in the US will be over, and we’re all back to our gremlin caves and our desks with piles of Cheetos Puffs.

What games have fallen on your plate in the last month?</strong></h2><p>Two games have taken up a lot of my time lately: <strong>Astro Bot</strong> and <strong>Into the Breach</strong>. </p><p>Astro Bot had absolutely no business being so amazing. I thought Astro’s Playroom was a fun platformer back when it came out, but Astro Bot dials it up to 11. I platinumed it in just a weekend and had fun every second I was doing it. The creativity in the level design and pure joy in the little moments are things I haven’t seen since I first played Super Mario Galaxy. I truly think Astro Bot has a fair shot for GOTY. </p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:1600px" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f4954920b0eab6f9ff28aa_AD_4nXdVieoKZwqDdUxYbt6Wua_TIQZP6mf4CLpx5Jh8K5IY8pzwyC-MDueAHL61IRz4EydBB51uqjpmxrUrqOVIV5X-cNuf2YigpFVCmz-rXfDQ2dBThkq8SH0btZEbNdexj7mb4BXZaE7PQhiBpnJzXYeizOxh.png" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot from the game “Astro Bot.” "/></div><figcaption>Astro Bot (<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/">PlayStation Store</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Into the Breach came out in 2018 but I’m just getting around to picking it up. It’s great on my Switch, and to me, it plays like a mix of mini-chess and a roguelite. It’s a turn-based strategy game where you command giant mechs to protect your people from the dastardly Vek creatures! My joy-cons have definitely been sweaty with how tense this game gets…excuse me while I go play it again right now.</p><h2><strong>When you’re traveling out of town or across the world, what are your go-to games for when you’re on the move? </strong></h2><p>When I’m going I’m still gaming! My Switch is with me quite often, especially when I’m in planes, trains, and automobiles. If it’s not a new game I’m playing, I tend to go back to some games that feel timeless to me. Usually, that means I’ll discover some new secret in <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> that I missed in my first 150 hours (pff amateur!!). <strong>Dead Cells </strong>is another go-to for me, and I think <strong>Balatro </strong>will be, too. Even though Balatro’s newer, it got to the point where I’d see those floating cards in my sleep so, yeah, that’s a good travel pick. </p><p>I don’t want to leave out my trusty mobile puzzle games, either! I’ve been trying to beat my friend’s high score of <strong>1010!</strong> for years. Also, a lot of airplane seat screens now have <strong>2048</strong> built into them, so it’s great for plane rides but maybe not-so-great for the person sitting in front of me who just feels my finger swiping on their seat for an hour. </p></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/discord-update-september-26-2024-changelog" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ecb1eaa5561774cf2c00d5_650233ad5dcf4b6825522e09_Fall_September.png 1800w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/product" class="blog-hero-category">Product &amp; Features</a><a href="/blog/discord-update-september-26-2024-changelog" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">Discord Update: September 26, 2024 Changelog</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>‍<em>Here are the Discord updates from September 26, 2024.

Our platform was built by people who love to play games, for people who love to play games. And today, over 90% of the 200 million people using Discord monthly spend over 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles each month. That’s why we’ve been hard at work building our <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview">Embedded App SDK</a> so we can enable even more game developers to bring experiences to Discord that our users love.</p><p><strong>Today, we’re excited to announce the next big step in our developer ecosystem</strong>: <strong>we are officially opening Discord Activities to all developers. </strong>Whether you’re creating games, music experiences, or other interactive Activities with the Embedded App SDK, you can now build, launch, distribute, get discovered, and monetize natively on Discord. Read on to learn more.</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>Reimagining Friend Groups and Social Gameplay <br/></strong></h2><p>From Day 1, we built Discord as a platform that developers could extend and customize to their needs with apps. Our thriving ecosystem of apps is used by over 25% of our monthly active users, and we’re seeing incredible early traction with early access Activity developers like <a href="https://discord.com/build-case-studies/playroom">Death by AI</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/build-case-studies/frvr">Krunker Strike FRVR</a>, and Farm Merge Valley.</p><p>Since building our first in-house Activity in 2022, we&#x27;ve believed that the unique environment of Discord, where friends hang out in servers and game on voice calls, could foster creativity and innovation in social gaming. As we set out to build the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview">Embedded App SDK</a>, we started to reimagine how friend groups might hang out together when they had easy access to lightweight and highly engaging games that were a click away from anywhere within Discord. </p><p>This is where Discord shines. Developers can leverage our naturally social communities to let already engaged players connect, play, and build relationships. True social gaming isn’t just about playing with friends; it’s about finding new ones too — and we make both possible.</p><p>When we rolled out the developer preview of the Embedded App SDK earlier this year, it was a <em>hit</em>. Tens of thousands of developers quickly started bringing their ideas to life. We believe this growing interest will push the boundaries of social gaming and help accelerate growth and innovation for a broader set of developers.</p><p>Soon after, we started to hear developers asking and thinking about the same types of questions that we&#x27;d been exploring around the future of social gaming, Questions like: what would it look like for groups of friends to work together in their games, across the day and over different time zones? How would memes emerge if games had bots that were natively embedded into the actual conversation? How might generative AI evolve with a built-in social communication layer?</p><p>Just as we saw with some of the most ubiquitous app ecosystems of the past decade, Discord’s open platform is a new frontier for game developers that will foster a whole new set of concepts and ideas to go viral.</p><p>From our conversations with many developers, it’s clear that building on Discord allows them to get straight to the full expression of what they want to build. Developers are finding an accelerated path to product-market fit by building and scaling social games and experiences where a young, early adopter base already hangs out. With access to strong social channels, they can get immediate feedback, fresh ideas, and real-time insights into how people interact with their products. </p><p>Playroom&#x27;s launch of &quot;<a href="https://discord.com/build-case-studies/playroom">Death by AI</a>&quot; is a prime example. By gathering user feedback directly on Discord, they were able to prioritize key features and fixes, optimize the game in over 10 languages, add AI voices, introduce new prompt packs, and implement in-app purchases — it captivated nearly 7 million players and accumulated over 1 million hours of gameplay in just weeks. </p><figure style="max-width:1600pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66f328b1a299281d7fff9038_AD_4nXdAwvBHhfcJWB3yUrOkc2jCquehKzVcSk_fFd5gZYHZeT0TnTY23arDTaAmAch75qgZYy92BoW3ETTevh4VDG5jNmxloFq-sQyvs8AyRNb39cuYfHUbbSydZgmiQSQFFveTbLir5ZdJQL5RZfraQcuR1Ie9.png" loading="lazy" alt="Ten users playing the Activity “Death by AI” in an ongoing Discord call on the desktop app."/></div><figcaption><em>Users playing Death by AI with the developers of the game, Playroom, and providing feedback directly on Discord</em></figcaption></figure><p>And, they’re just one of many examples of accelerated growth thanks to Discord’s vibrant, naturally social environment.

After all, the faster our app gets, the sooner you can return to your friends and conversations!   </p><p>Over the last six months, we embarked on a quest to support this endeavor, working to reduce the amount of bandwidth our clients use, especially on iOS and Android, hoping that decreasing bandwidth usage would lead to a more responsive experience.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>When your client connects to Discord, it receives real-time updates about what’s happening through a service that we call the “gateway.” Since late 2017, the client’s gateway connection has been compressed using zlib, making messages anywhere from 2 to 10 times smaller.</p><p>Since then, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a> (originally released in 2015) has gained enough traction to become a viable replacement for zlib. Zstandard offers higher compression ratios and shorter compression times and supports <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd#dictionary-compression-how-to">dictionaries</a>: a way to preemptively exchange information about compressed content, further increasing compression ratios and reducing the overall bandwidth usage.</p><p>We attempted to use zstandard in the past, but, at the time, the benefits weren’t worth the costs. Our testing in 2019 was desktop-only and used too much RAM. However, a lot can happen in five years! We wanted to give it another try, and the support for dictionaries appealed to us, especially as most of our gateway payloads are small and in a well-defined shape.</p><p>We believed the predictability of these payloads would be a perfect application of dictionaries to further reduce bandwidth usage.</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>Armed with this knowledge, we put on our lab coats, slapped on our goggles, and started experimenting. On paper, we thought zstandard would be better than zlib but we wanted to validate this theory against our current workload.</p><p>We opted to do a “dark launch” of plain zstandard: the plan was to compress a small percentage of production traffic both with zlib and zstandard, collect a bunch of metrics, then discard the zstandard data. This allowed us to experiment with zstandard to quickly compare its results against zlib. Without this experiment, we would have to add zstandard support for our clients — desktop, iOS, and Android — which would require about a month’s lead time before we could fully determine the effects of zstandard. We didn’t know how well zstandard would perform and didn’t want to wait a whole month, but a dark launch allowed us to iterate over days as opposed to weeks.</p><p>Once we got our experiment set up and deployed onto our gateway cluster, we set up a dashboard to see how zstandard performed. We flipped the switch to start sending a teeeeeny bit of traffic through the dark launch code, and the initial results appeared to be… underwhelming. Zstandard was performing <em>worse</em> than zlib was.</p><figure style="max-width:752pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb5caa61ad96d1a395f51d_AD_4nXeCYg9XJmJM9EPtYhMpoXSrE89c5FHDpTPo-_g1CsEEAhiib-D8EUGRZlxPL9CDWw0hmSeRVdGLCJPqkwdIpt5oi80KsHQL5bxIJfOJ3dC76sFgSpj8Lh4f6lqEfsZXpdpywTPUdoEFsRo6WIPHiLyQMmt9.png" loading="lazy" alt="A compression ratio chart for Zstandard.

Embeddings are simple but powerful structures that capture complex data as a series of numbers — a vector — and are a natural way to represent many things within machine learning models. In LLMs, embeddings represent words (or tokens). <br/><br/>Here at Discord, we built DERE, or Discord&#x27;s Entity-Relationship Embeddings, which represent things like servers (in this article, we’ll use their technical term “guilds”), users, games, and other entities. Just as embeddings from LLMs have made it easy to build text-based applications quickly and easily, these embeddings make it easy for ML engineers at Discord to build models and generate insights from our data faster than ever.</p><figure style="max-width:2314pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66ec5b3f4a3667839cb3be49_66ec5b128c4a74ebd8e0924b_Trends%2520Chart.png" loading="lazy" alt="A line chart explaining how large the interest in the term &quot;embeddings&quot; over a 20-year timeframe. "/></div></figure><p>If you’re familiar with Natural Language Processing, this technique is used to build pre-trained word representations from text. In the NLP setup, the relationships between words are defined by the neighbors of any given word. So, in the sentence “the cat sat”, you could say “cat” has a relationship to “the” and “sat”.</p><figure style="max-width:1600pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb62dad2a4312899562691_AD_4nXcx7AdBHtXDPfK3PSeHKCDCK2sRSONqypbnpkXlT678xxZlIKDRhP4LPwTGm4m19uPLNjBN2B52ZOKehb1KsOlxyTYQ3hr1ZBlE7MvbEBOGoTBwxSlUi_PqJOnVFxB5B6E54coM-eUHgBTV5X0_kePoRBA_.png" loading="lazy" alt="An example of relationships in Natural Language Processing.

"/></div></figure><p>‍</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>What is DERE?</strong></h2><p>DERE is the mechanism Discord uses to build meaningful representations from raw data. <br/><br/>At its core, DERE pre-trains embeddings for each user, guild, game, and various other entities. Effectively, it maps entity IDs, like guild ID or game IDs, to a vector which can then be used in various ways. </p><figure style="max-width:1600pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb6307ed97b6930078d251_AD_4nXfSaxH4aEim-FvzopFHAN3gVBF6pAZPwHJwXsc3haD2SZCZj8yDiKe6XYB_6sngFAOv7ksRqZusWV-_39IB4wx0oVcPhI_fo9axyjhFfLw-hBXximvkssmqRhQb9SJvGz5VZmiNCPglaSc96qW2Ux1JDNY.png" loading="lazy" alt="A diagram showing some of the relationships used in DERE. Users have relationships to their friends, to games they play, and to the guilds they’re in. Bots also have a relationship to the guild they’re in."/></div></figure><p> </p><p>DERE relies solely on social graph-based features, such as relationships between users and their interactions within the platform (e.g. what guilds you’re in). If you re-imagine the NLP example above and tilt your head slightly, you could sort of make a sentence out of this… maybe something like: “Nelly is friends with Clyde.” In DERE, our setup is pretty much exactly like this! Nelly-&gt;is_friend-&gt;Clyde. While simple, this is very powerful at scale.</p><figure style="max-width:1600pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb63b3d2a4312899574ed2_AD_4nXdFWkLiEweEsuKwbIAhF4LnZr0zpp6butkg1-hZpShQUxbj6s3OV-KnJBsXGpAQT2WKFNRI4rhVLIGi_kq_xlBv85B7jVcf95zZVRyzkj-jXlS8NGchT_G7tgNgO-SGn6Is2VEfJBDwqvzU-8uIyn2ZCpQc.png" loading="lazy" alt="On the left: A diagram showing an NLP example of the sentence “Nelly is friends with Clyde” with the input being Nelly, the projection being the neighbors, and the output being the rest of the sentence. On the right: A diagram showing a DERE example of Nelly’s relationships to guilds, friends, and games."/></div></figure><p>Under the hood, DERE uses an unsupervised machine learning technique known as “contrastive learning,” which trains on triplets of head-relation-tail (h, r, t) examples. The data used in DERE is broken down into these triples, which our ML models can use to unravel the relationships and build useful representations.</p><p>Examples of (h, r, t) triples include:</p><figure style="max-width:1223pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb67d59edce9bf14d5c888_66eb64ee7365f48e44c51061_image1.png" loading="lazy" alt="Table of examples of head, relation, tail (h, r, t) triples with an explanation for each. Row one shows that a user has a relationship to a guild that they are a member of. Row two shows that two users that are friends have an edge between them. Row three shows that channels belong to guilds."/></div></figure><p>An example of what the model sees during training time is:</p><p><strong>(h, r, t) = (661027446241361930, 17, 974519864045756446)</strong></p><p>Where this particular example is the edge between my user ID and the OpenAI server ID. Relation 17 (at the time of writing) is the “user_in_guild” relationship.</p><p>Training is thus two embedding lookups: one for the embedding for my user ID and the other for the embedding of the server ID. The relation ID is then used to choose which model we’ll use to transform these entities into the same space:</p><figure style="max-width:1424pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb67d69edce9bf14d5c8db_66eb653de82f29ae30c7b6d1_image5.png" loading="lazy" alt="An equation showing a scoring function for a particular relationship that inputs two embedding vectors for the head and tail entities, and is equal to a comparator function such as dot product or cosine distance that inputs the head entity embedding and additionally applies a transformation such as translation or diagonal multiplication to the tail entity embedding."/></div></figure><p>Our positive examples are all of the edges that exist between any two entities in our graph, such as my user ID and a guild that I’m in. Negative examples are constructed on-the-fly during train time by randomly corrupting positive examples. So continuing the example above, an example would be my user id in guild &lt;xyz&gt; where I’m not actually in that guild. Because our training data is massive, corrupting positive edges is a safe operation. To give an idea of how big these graphs can get, we operate on billions of entities and tens of billions of relationships.</p><p>Our loss function during training is a ranking loss called triplet margin loss which optimizes related entities to be nearby each other in their embedding space, and unrelated entities to be further away from each other. We could also use logistic or softmax loss, depending on use case.</p><p>Continuing from the above example, my (h, r, t) triple is considered a positive example since it exists in the training data. If we corrupted the edges within the batch, would could wind up with a negative example like</p><p><strong>(h, r, t) = (661027446241361930, 17, 560127830160048128)</strong></p><p>Where the tail was randomly selected and is a Rust server I’m not a member of.</p><p>Now we can take the positive and negative examples and calculate our loss:</p><figure style="max-width:1438pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66eb67d79edce9bf14d5ca50_66eb65b0cc4fabad4f6fe34b_image7.png" loading="lazy" alt="An equation showing the triplet margin ranking loss which takes the maximum of 0 and margin parameter minus the scores for the positive example plus the score for the negative example(s)"/></div></figure><p>We use this loss to update the learned transformation as well as the embeddings themselves.</p></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-small w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video" class="link-block-4 w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/66e887e79d3b4d4fc25d279f_E2EE%2004.png 1800w" class="blog-featured-small-image"/></a><a href="/category/engineering" class="blog-hero-category">Engineering &amp; Developers</a><a href="/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video" class="link-block-19 w-inline-block"><div class="blog-featured-title-small">Meet DAVE: Discord’s New End-to-End Encryption for Audio &amp; Video</div></a><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><p>Last year, we <a href="https://discord.com/blog/encryption-for-voice-and-video-on-discord">announced</a> that we were experimenting with new encryption protocols and technologies for audio and video calls on Discord. After extensive experimenting, designing, developing, and auditing, <a href="http://discord.com/safety/more-private-and-secure">we’re excited to announce</a> Discord’s audio and video end-to-end encryption (“E2EE A/V” or “E2EE” for short), which we like to refer to as our DAVE protocol.</p><p>Discord is committed to protecting the privacy and data of the roughly 200 million people who use our platform every month. As we continue to be a place that helps our users deepen friendships around games and shared interests, we are thrilled to be launching more secure and private voice and video calls. </p><p>Today, we’ll start migrating voice and video in DMs, Group DMs, voice channels, and Go Live streams to use E2EE. You will be able to confirm when calls are end-to-end encrypted and perform verification of other members in those calls. </p><p>We’d like to explain why we’re bringing E2EE A/V to Discord, share our design and implementation goals, and provide a high-level technical overview of how the new protocol works.</p></div><div class="rich-hide w-richtext"><h2><strong>What We’ve Been Up To<br/></strong></h2><p>When it comes to building a secure and trusted E2EE A/V protocol, transparency is key.

Moving forward, any changes to either the protocol or our code will be reflected in those repositories.</p><p>In the past few months, we collaborated closely with <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com">Trail of Bits</a>, a renowned independent cybersecurity firm, to conduct a thorough review of both the design and implementation of DAVE in our code base. With DAVE’s launch, Trail of Bits is publishing their findings from both the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-08-discord-dave-protocol-designreview.pdf">design review</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-09-discord-dave-protocol-codereview.pdf">implementation review</a>.</p><p>Safety is intertwined with our product and policies. While audio and video will be end-to-end encrypted, messages on Discord will continue to follow our <a href="https://discord.com/safety/our-approach-to-content-moderation">content moderation</a> approach and are not end-to-end encrypted.
